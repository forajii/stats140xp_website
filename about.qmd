I am a statistics and data science major and history minor at UCLA. I have a more human-oriented approach when it comes to analyzing data, as oftentimes metrics collected and aggregated in databases may not always reflect the ground reality of many different company services.

My current focus for business applications is in data engineering, data analysis, and data science. It is crucial to have a solid foundation in these three domains because they form the backbone of the entire data science workflow (CRISP-DM).

## Profile


![](images/profile.jpg){width="180px"}


I am passionate about data science/engineering, machine learning/AI, and history. I have experience with programming languages such as SQL, Python, C++ and R, as well as with business intelligence tools such as Tableau and PowerBI. I have also used data containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes in the past. 

My personal research focuses on bridging certain topics from history with the use of methods from data science and machine learning. These include using machine learning models to perform price prediction of fine art on the art auction market and utilizing computer vision to decipher ancient scrolls.
