The objective of this project is to use machine learning models to predict art price to discern a pattern of which factors influence art prices more.\nSee More"

The goal of this project was to analyze the trends of the S&P 500 in the past few years to determine which aspects of it are still an attractive investment.\nSee More"

    "text": "League of Legends Rank Prediction\nAlthough traditional machine learning models excel on tabular data, a major impetus for this project was to determine if neural networks can deliver similar results. The main objective is to use neural networks such as TabTransformer to see how well it would perform on tabular data such as in predicting ranks in video games such as League of Legends.\nSee More"

Our goal in this presentation is to determine how the current state of lobbying in Los Angeles functions in relationship to the interests of Los Angeles residents.\nSee More"

    "text": "I am a statistics and data science major and history minor at UCLA. I have a more human-oriented approach when it comes to analyzing data, as oftentimes metrics collected and aggregated in databases may not always reflect the ground reality of many different company services.\nMy current focus for business applications is in data engineering, data analysis, and data science. It is crucial to have a solid foundation in these three domains because they form the backbone of the entire data science workflow (CRISP-DM)."

I have experience with programming languages such as SQL, Python, C++ and R, as well as with business intelligence tools such as Tableau and PowerBI. I have also used data containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes in the past.\nMy personal research focuses on bridging certain topics from history with the use of methods from data science and machine learning. These include using machine learning models to perform price prediction of fine art on the art auction market and utilizing computer vision to decipher ancient scrolls."
